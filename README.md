# Scrcpy_Wireless
Wireless Version of Scrcpy
This application provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access. It works on GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS.
It focuses on:
lightness (native, displays only the device screen)
performance (30~60fps)
quality (1920Ã—1080 or above)
low latency (35~70ms)
low startup time (~1 second to display the first image)
non-intrusiveness (nothing is left installed on the device)
#Get the app
For Windows, for simplicity, a prebuilt archive with all the dependencies (including adb) is available: https://tinyurl.com/Scrcpy
